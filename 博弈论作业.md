#### 1. Prove that Rock-Paper-Scissors game has a unique Nash equilibrium,  which is uniform over these three actions

The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a two-player zero-sum game with the following payoff matrix (where the rows represent player 1's strategies and the columns represent player 2's strategies):
$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc} & \text{Rock} & \text{Paper} & \text{Scissors} \\ \hline \text{Rock} & {(0,0)} & (-1,1) & (1,-1 )\\ \text{Paper} & (1,-1) & (0,0) & (-1,1) \\ \text{Scissors} & (-1,1) & (1,-1) & (0,0) \\ \end{array}
$$
We consider mixed strategies where each player randomly chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors with certain probabilities.Let $p_R$, $p_P$, and $p_S$ be the probabilities that player 1 chooses Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively. Similarly, let $q_R$, $q_P$, and $q_S$ be the probabilities that player 2 chooses Rock, Paper, and Scissors, respectively. For the strategies to be mixed, they must satisfy:
$$
p_R + p_P + p_S = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad q_R + q_P + q_S = 1
$$
For player 1, the expected payoffs for choosing each strategy are:

$E_1(\text{Rock}) = q_R \cdot 0 + q_P \cdot (-1) + q_S \cdot 1 = -q_P + q_S$

 $E_1(\text{Paper}) = q_R \cdot 1 + q_P \cdot 0 + q_S \cdot (-1) = q_R - q_S$

 $E_1(\text{Scissors}) = q_R \cdot (-1) + q_P \cdot 1 + q_S \cdot 0 = -q_R + q_P$

For player 1 to be indifferent between all three strategies (which is required for a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium), these expected payoffs must be equal:

$-q_P + q_S = q_R - q_S = -q_R + q_P$

This implies:

$-q_P + q_S = q_R - q_S$

$q_R - q_S = -q_R + q_P$

$-q_P + q_S = q_R - q_S \quad \Rightarrow \quad q_P + q_R = 2q_S \quad (i)$

$q_R - q_S = -q_R + q_P \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2q_R = q_S + q_P \quad (ii)$

Adding  (i) and (ii):

$q_P + q_R + 2q_R = 2q_S + q_S \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3q_R = 3q_S \quad \Rightarrow \quad q_R = q_S$

Substituting $q_R = q_S$ into  (i):

$q_P + q_R = 2q_R \quad \Rightarrow \quad q_P = q_R$

Thus :

$q_R = q_P = q_S = \frac{1}{3}$

The unique mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for the Rock Paper Scissors game is for each player to choose Rock, Paper, and Scissors with equal probability $\frac{1}{3}$.

#### 2. Prove that if a finite game admits a potential function then it has at least  one pure equilibrium.

##### Proof:

Assume the finite game $G$ admits a potential function $\Phi$.Since $G$ is a finite game, the set of all possible strategy profiles $S$ is finite. Because $S$ is finite and $\Phi$ maps $S$ to$\mathbb{R}$, $\Phi$ must attain a minimum value on $S$. Let $s^*$ be a strategy profile where $\Phi$ is minimized.

Consider any player $i$and a deviation from their strategy $s_i^*$ in $s^*$ to some other strategy $s_i'$.

By the definition of the potential function, the change in $\Phi$ due to this deviation is equal to the change in player $i$'s payoff: $u_i(s_i', s_{-i}^*) - u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) = \Phi(s_i', s_{-i}^*) - \Phi(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*)$

Since $s^*$ is a minimizer of $\Phi$, we have $\Phi(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \leq \Phi(s_i', s_{-i}^*)$ for all $s_i'$. Therefore, $u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq u_i(s_i', s_{-i}^*)$.

This means no player $i$ can improve their payoff by unilaterally deviating from $s_i^*$, $s^*$ is a Nash equilibrium. Since $s^*$ is a minimizer of the potential function $\Phi$ and no player can improve their payoff by deviating unilaterally, $s^*$ is a pure Nash equilibrium.

#### 3. Please give the statement of Myerson‚Äôs Lemma and prove it.

Lemma [Myerson, 1981] 

(a) An allocation rule ùíô is implementable if and only if it is  monotone 

(b) For every allocation rule ùíô, there exists a unique payment rule  ùíë such that $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})$ is a truthful auction

The lemma states that for an allocation rule $\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{b}) = (x_1(\mathbf{b}), \ldots, x_n(\mathbf{b}))$ to be implementable (there exists a payment rule $\mathbf{p}(\mathbf{b}) = (p_1(\mathbf{b}), \ldots, p_n(\mathbf{b}))$ such that $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})$ defines a truthful mechanism), the allocation rule must be monotone in each bidder's bid. 

**Proof**:

Assume $(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})$ is truthful. Consider any $0 \le y < z$. Since the auction is truthful, it must be the case that: $z \cdot x(z) - p(z) \ge z \cdot x(y) - p(y) \quad \text{and} \quad y \cdot x(y) - p(y) \ge y \cdot x(z) - p(z)$

Rearranging these inequalities, we get: $y \cdot [x(z) - x(y)] \le p(z) - p(y) \le z \cdot [x(z) - x(y)]$

This implies that $x(z) \ge x(y)$ for $z > y$, showing that $x$ must be monotone.

Given that $x$ is monotone, we need to find the payment rule $p$ such that the mechanism is truthful.

assuming $x$ is differentiable, we have: $\frac{p(z) - p(y)}{z - y} \le x(z) \le \frac{p(z) - p(y)}{y - z}$

Taking the limit as $y$ approaches $z$: $p'(z) = z \cdot x'(z)$

Integrating this equation from 0 to $b_i$ and assuming $p(0) = 0$: $p_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) = \int_0^{b_i} z \cdot x'(z) \, dz$

 $p_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) = b_i \cdot x_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) - \int_0^{b_i} x_i(z, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) \, dz$

The utility of bidder $i$ is: $u_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) = v_i \cdot x_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) - p_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i})$

Substituting the payment rule: $u_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) = (v_i - b_i) \cdot x_i(b_i, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) + \int_0^{b_i} x_i(z, \mathbf{b}_{-i}) \, dz$

Since $x$ is monotone, this utility is maximized when $b_i = v_i$, ensuring that the mechanism is truthful.

#### 4. Please give a complete proof of the $\frac{1}{\sqrt m}$-approximate mechanism of  the single-minded auction

##### Proof:

Each bidder $i$ has a private set $T_i$ and a private value $v_i$.

A bid is represented as $(b_i, S_i)$, where $b_i$ is the bid value and $S_i$ is the subset of items the bidder is interested in.

The objective is to maximize the social welfare.

Start with an empty set of winners $W$.Sort bidders by their bid-per-item ratio, $\frac{b_i}{|S_i|}$, in descending order.

Iterate through bidders in sorted order. For each bidder $i$: If $S_i$ does not overlap with any $S_j$ for $j \in W$, add $i$ to $W$.

Allocate $S_i$ to each $i \in W$.

Set $p_i = 0$ if $i \notin W$.

For $i \in W$, find the minimum bid $b_{\alpha(i)}$ such that $i$ would still win if they bid $b_{\alpha(i)}$. Set $p_i = b_{\alpha(i)} \frac{|S_{\alpha(i)}|}{|S_i|}$. The critical payment ensures bidders bid truthfully as they pay the smallest amount that ensures their win.

Let $OPT$ be the optimal social welfare. The greedy algorithm produces a solution with social welfare $SW$. It can be shown that $SW \geq \sqrt m OPT$, where $\sqrt m$ is the approximation factor.

#### 5. Please give a complete proof of Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem. (See  7a.arrow.pdf)

##### Arrow‚Äôs Impossibility Theorem: Any social welfare function $W$ that satisfies PE and IIA must be dictatorial

**Pareto Efficiency** (PE): If every individual prefers option A over option B, then the social welfare function should also prefer A over B.

**Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives** (IIA): The social preference between any two options should depend only on the individual preferences between those two options and not on the presence or absence of other options.

**Non-dictatorship**: There is no single individual whose preferences always dictate the social welfare function.

##### Proof:

##### Step 1: Extremal Outcomes

Consider an outcome $b$ such that every voter ranks $b$ at either the top or bottom of their preference list. According to PE and IIA, $b$ must be ranked at the top or bottom in the social preference $\succ_W$.

Assume every voter prefers $a$ over $c$ and $b$ is at an extremal position. By PE, $a \succ_W c$. Now, if each voter moves $c$ just above $a$ in their preference list, $a \succ_W b$ and $b \succ_W c$ must still hold, hence $a \succ_W c$ due to transitivity.

##### Step 2: Existence of an Extremely Pivotal Voter

A voter $n^*$ is extremely pivotal for an outcome $b$ if changing their ranking of $b$ from top to bottom (or vice versa) changes $b$'s position in the social ranking from top to bottom (or vice versa).

Given $a \succ_W b$ and $b \succ_W c$, moving $b$ to the top or bottom by $n^*$ should reverse these rankings due to IIA and PE.

##### Step 3: Dictatorship over Other Pairs

The extremely pivotal voter $n^*$ from Step 2 must dictate the social preference over any other pair of outcomes not involving $b$. By IIA, the preference between $a$ and $c$ should depend on $n^*$ alone.

##### Step 4: General Dictatorship

Finally, consider a third outcome $c$. Another extremely pivotal voter $n^{**}$ should exist for $c$, dictating preferences involving $c$. However, by Step 3, $n^*$should already dictate preferences between $a$ and $c$. Hence, $n^*$ and $n^{**}$ must be the same, establishing $n^*$ as a general dictator.

Thus, any social welfare function $W$ that satisfies PE and IIA must be dictatorial, proving Arrow's Impossibility Theorem

#### 6. Prove the correctness of the LMM Algorithm. (See NE.pdf)

Theorem
For any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, there exists an $\epsilon$-ANE where each player plays only $k = O\left(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ actions with positive probability.

##### Proof :

The LMM algorithm uses a probabilistic method, where it approximates the original NE with a large enough sample size from the distribution. The sample complexity is such that the probability of deviating significantly from the expected utility is low.

The Chernoff bound is used to ensure that the empirical mean of the utilities (payoffs) from the sampled strategies is close to the expected mean.

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k$ be k i.i.d. random variables (over$[0,1]$) representing the payoffs. For any $\epsilon > 0$ and the mean $E[X]$, we have: 
$$
Pr\left[\left| \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k X_i - E[X] \right| \geq \epsilon \right] \leq 2 \exp\left(-2k\epsilon^2\right)
$$
Let $(x, y)$ be any NE of the instance.

Take $k$ i.i.d. samples (actions) ($r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_k$) from the distribution $x$.

Let $\tilde{x}$ be the empirical strategy which plays $r_i$ uniformly at random. Similarly, construct $\tilde{y}$ for player 2.

When $k$ is large enough, the following holds: 
$$
\left| e_i^T R y - e_i^T R \tilde{y} \right| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \left| x^T C e_j - \tilde{x}^T C e_j \right| \leq \frac{\epsilon}{2} \quad \forall i, j \in [n]
$$
Combining the bounds, for sufficiently large $k$, we get:
$$
e_i^T R \tilde{y} \leq e_i^T R y + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k e_{r_j}^T R y + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \leq \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^k e_{r_j}^T R \tilde{y} + \epsilon = \tilde{x}^T R \tilde{y} + \epsilon
$$
This implies: $\tilde{x}^T R \tilde{y} \geq \tilde{x}'^T R \tilde{y} - \epsilon \quad \forall \tilde{x}' \in \Delta_n$

 Similarly, $\tilde{x}^T C \tilde{y} \geq \tilde{x}^T C \tilde{y}' - \epsilon \quad \forall \tilde{y}' \in \Delta_n$

The probability that any of the bad cases (deviation greater than $\epsilon/2$) happens is at most $4n \exp\left(-k\epsilon^2/2\right)$. For $k > \frac{2 \log(4n)}{\epsilon^2}$, this probability is less than 1, ensuring with high probability that the empirical strategies $(\tilde{x}, \tilde{y})$ form an $\epsilon$-ANE.
